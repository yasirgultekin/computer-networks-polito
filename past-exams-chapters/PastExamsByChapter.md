**4.** In a network using packet switching technology (packet switching), assuming that a user wants to
transmit X-bit binary data, the source node needs to go through k (k>1) channels from the source node
to the destination node, and the signal propagation delay of each channel is d seconds; the length of the
data in the packet is p bits, and the length of the packet header is h bits (assuming X>> p+h ); the data
transmission rate of the packet switching network is r bps (that is, each channel in the packet switching

network data transfer rate). In order to minimize the delay of the packet from the source node to the
destination node, find the value of p (without considering the queuing time at the intermediate node).
answer:
The delay time for a message to arrive at the destination node from the source node is:
(X/p*( p+h ))/r + d + (k- 1)( d+( p+h )/r) = (( p+h )/r )(X/p + (k-1 )) + k*d
Deriving the above formula and making it equal to 0, the value of p can be obtained

**2.** What is simplex, half-duplex , and full-duplex communication?
Answer: Simplex communication means that the data communication line always transmits in one
direction.
At the same time, a channel only allows one-way transmission, and half-duplex communication requires
both A and B terminals to have a sending device and a receiving device.
Full-duplex communication can carry out communication in two directions at the same time, that is, two
channels, which can carry out two-way data transmission at the same time. Full-duplex communication
has high efficiency and is easy to control, and is suitable for communication between computers.

**18.** Briefly describe the functions of the following protocols: IP, ARP, RARP, and ICMP.
IP protocol: realize network interconnection. It makes the networks with different performances
participating in the interconnection appear as a unified network to the user. The Internet Protocol IP is
one of the two most important protocols in the TCP/IP system, and there are four other protocols used
in conjunction with the IP protocol.

ARP protocol: It solves the mapping problem between the IP address and the hardware address of the
host or router on the same LAN.
RARP: It solves the mapping problem between the hardware address and IP address of the host or
router on the same LAN.
ICMP: Provides error reporting and inquiry messages to improve the chances of successful delivery of IP
data
Internet Group Management Protocol IGMP: Used to search and forward group membership in the local
area network.
19 Explain the difference between IP address and hardware address, why use these two different
addresses?
The IP address is to assign a worldwide unique 32-bit identifier to each host (or router) connected to the
Internet. view the entire Internet as a single, abstract network
When transmitting data frames on the link of the actual network, the hardware address must finally be
used.
To a certain extent, the MAC address is consistent with the hardware. Based on physics, it can identify
specific link communication objects, and the IP address is given to the division of logical domains, and is
not limited by hardware.
20 Try to identify the network category of the following IP addresses.
(1) 128.36.199.3 (2) 21.12.240.17 (3) 183.194.76.253 (4) 192.12.69.248

Why does RIP periodically exchange router information with neighboring sites but BGP does not?
Answer: RIP only exchanges information with neighboring stations, there is no reliable guarantee for
using UDP, but the overhead is small, which can meet the requirements of RIP;
OSPF uses a reliable flooding method and directly uses IP, which is flexible and has low overhead;

BGP needs to exchange the entire routing table and update information, and TCP provides reliable
delivery to reduce bandwidth consumption;
RIP uses UDP, which does not guarantee reliable delivery, so it must constantly (periodically) exchange
information with neighboring stations to update routing information in a timely manner. But BGP uses
TCP which guarantees reliable delivery so there is no need for this.
twenty four. Try to explain the status and role of the transport layer in the protocol stack. What is the
important difference between the communication of the transport layer and the communication of the
network layer? Why is the transport layer essential?
the highest layer of the communication-oriented part , and it is also the lowest layer of user functions,
providing services to the application layer above it
The transport layer provides end-to-end logical communication between application processes, but the
network layer provides logical communication between hosts (host-oriented, responsible for routing
functions, that is, host addressing and effective packet switching).
The communication between various application processes requires two types of service quality of
"reliable or best effort", which must be loaded by the transport layer to the network layer in the form of
multiplexing and demultiplexing.

connection-oriented or connectionless-oriented?
Answer: Both are. This has to be seen at different levels, the transport layer is connection-oriented, and
the network layer is connectionless
**27.** Why is it said that UDP is packet-oriented, while TCP is byte-oriented?
Answer: The sender UDP sends down the packet to the IP layer after adding a header to the packet
delivered by the application. UDP neither combines nor splits the packets delivered by the application
layer, but preserves the boundaries of these packets.
The receiver UDP delivers the UDP user datagram delivered by the IP layer to the application process of
the upper layer intact after removing the header, and delivers a complete message at a time.
The sender TCP regards the message data block delivered by the application program as an unstructured
byte stream (no boundary constraints, can be split/merged), but maintains each byte
**28.** What is the role of the port?

Answer: The function of the port is to unify the application process of the TCP/IP system, so that the
application processes of computers running different operating systems can communicate with each
other
**29.** Why is there a header length field in the TCP header, but there is no such field in the UDP header?

Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locator URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to mark various documents
on the World Wide Web, and make each document within the scope of the entire Internet. Has a unique
identifier URL.
HTTP: In order to realize various links on the World Wide Web , it is necessary to make the interaction
between the World Wide Web client program and the World Wide Web server program follow a strict

protocol, which is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP.HTTP is an application layer protocol that uses
TCP connections for reliable transmission.

program.
Hypertext: The basic feature of hypertext is that you can hyperlink documents; you can point to other
locations, which can be in the current document, other documents on the local area network, or
documents anywhere on the Internet. These documents form a messy web of information. The target
document usually has some relationship to and enriches the source; link elements in the source convey
this relationship to the viewer.
**34.** Explain the following nouns. What is the original text of each English abbreviation?
Hypermedia, Active Documents, Search Engines.

appear in the active document. The title bar of the active document is highlighted. A Windows-based,
non-HTML application embedded in a browser that provides a means of accessing the functionality of
those applications from the browser interface.
Search engine: A search engine refers to a system that can automatically collect information from the
Internet, organize it, and provide it to users for reference.
**35.** What are the two types of search engines? What are the characteristics of each?
Answer: There are many types of search engines, which can be roughly divided into two categories,
namely full-text search engines and catalog search engines.
A full-text search engine is a purely technical search tool. Its working principle is to collect information
from various websites on the Internet through search software, and after finding a website, you can link
to another website from this website . Then build a large online database according to certain rules for
users to query. Users only need to input keywords when querying, and then query from the index
database that has been established (not the information retrieved on the Internet in real time).
The classification directory search engine does not collect any information of the website, but uses the
keywords and website description and other information filled in when the website information is
submitted by each website to the search engine. After manual review and editing, if it is deemed to

meet the conditions for website login, then It is input into the database of the classification directory for
online users to query.
**36.** What is the address format for email? Please explain what each part means.
Answer: The e-mail system of the TCP/IP system stipulates that the format of the e-mail address is as

The symbol "@" is read as "at", which means "at". For example, email address xiexiren@tsinghua.org.cn
**37.** Try to briefly describe the three-stage process of SMTP communication.
Answer: 1. Connection establishment: The connection is established between the SMTP client of the
sending host and the SMTP server of the receiving host. SMTP does not use an intermediate mail server.

**42.** Explain the main difference between UDP and TCP.
Answer: UDP is based on the IP protocol and provides the same unreliable and connectionless services
as the IP protocol. The UDP protocol does not use acknowledgment information to confirm the arrival of
packets. It cannot guarantee the order in which packets arrive, nor can it feed back information to the
source for flow control. As a result, packet loss and other phenomena may occur.
The TCP protocol is one of the most important protocols in the TCP/IP protocol suite, which provides
connection-oriented data stream transmission services. TCP must send the data out, and the application
on the destination host can receive the data in the correct order. On the contrary, UDP cannot
guarantee the reliable transmission of data, nor can it guarantee that the data will arrive at the
destination in the correct order.

**7.** Try to explain the following nouns: data, signal, analog data, analog signal, baseband signal,
Data: is the entity that conveys information.
Signal: is the electrical or electromagnetic manifestation of data.
Analog Data: An analog signal that conveys information.
Analog signal: A signal that changes continuously.
Baseband Signal (i.e. Fundamental Band Signal) - A signal from a source. Data signals representing
various text or image files output by a computer are all baseband signals.

**9.** Try to explain the following nouns: code unit, simplex communication, half-duplex communication,
full-duplex communication, bandpass signal
Code element (code): When a digital signal is represented by a waveform in the time domain (or simply
called the time domain), it represents the basic waveform of different discrete values.
Simplex communication: That is, there is only one direction of communication without interaction in the
opposite direction.
Half-duplex communication: that is, both parties in the communication can send information, but they
cannot send information at the same time (of course they cannot receive at the same time). This
communication method is that one party sends and the other receives, and then reverses after a period
of time.
Full-duplex communication: That is, both parties to the communication can send and receive
information at the same time.
Band-pass signal - After the baseband signal is modulated by the carrier, the frequency range of the
signal is moved to a higher frequency band for transmission in the channel (that is, the channel can only
pass through a frequency range).

10. What is the difference between a data link (that is, a logical link) and a link (that is, a physical link)?
What is the difference between "the circuit is connected" and " the data link is connected " ?
Answer: The difference between a data link and a link is that in addition to the data link, there must be
some necessary procedures to control the transmission of data. Therefore, the data link has more
hardware and hardware required to implement the communication procedures than the link. software.
"The circuit is connected" means that the node switches at both ends of the link have been turned on,
and the physical connection has been able to transmit bit streams. However, data transmission is not
reliable. On the basis of the physical connection, a data link connection is established, which is " The
data link is connected". After that, because the data link connection has the functions of detection,
confirmation and retransmission, the less reliable physical link becomes a reliable data link, and reliable
data transmission becomes a data link. When disconnecting, the physical circuit connection does not
necessarily follow the disconnection.

38.The principle of carrier sense multiple access/collision detection can be summarized as listening first
and then sending, listening while sending, conflict stop sending, and random retransmission.

**41.** The process of reducing conflicts in CSMA/CD is divided into two parts, namely, carrier sense and
collision detection. Briefly describe the working process of these two parts.
Answer: (1) Carrier monitoring is to test whether there is an envelope on the bus before each node
sends an envelope to the bus, that is, to test whether there is a carrier signal on the bus. If the bus is idle
at this time and there is no carrier signal, the node can transmit the envelope. If it is measured that the
bus is busy and there is a carrier signal, it needs to be delayed for a while before sending, and it still
needs to be tested before sending. Since this process is carried out before transmitting the envelope, it
is also called "listen before speaking".
(2) Collision detection The node sending the envelope sends the information bits to the bus through the
transmitter, and receives the information from the bus through the receiver. The sent information is
compared with the received information, and a conflict occurs when they are inconsistent. At this time,
the node sending the envelope will stop sending this time and prepare to resend. The advantage of
conflict detection is that conflicts can be found in time, without waiting for the entire envelope to be
sent, the destination station sends back a negative response or the timeout mechanism reports an error,
thereby improving transmission efficiency.

**2.** Briefly describe the working principle of the CSMA/CD protocol.

**2.** For an Ethernet with a length of 1km and a data transmission rate of 10Mbps, the propagation speed
of electrical signals on the Internet is 200m/us. Assume that the length of the Ethernet data frame is 256
bits, including a 64-bit frame header, checksum and other overheads. The first time slice after the data
frame is successfully sent is reserved for the receiver to send a 64-bit confirmation frame. Assuming the
network is very lightly loaded (i.e. disregarding any instances of collisions), what is the effective data
transfer rate for this Ethernet?

**2.** Briefly describe the working principle of the CSMA/CD protocol.
answer:
Before a station wants to send data, it must first listen to the channel;
(1) If the channel is idle, send data immediately and perform collision detection;
(2) If the channel is busy, continue to listen to the channel until the channel becomes idle, send data
immediately and perform collision detection.
(3) If the station detects a conflict during the process of sending data, it immediately stops sending data
and waits for a random long time to listen to the channel again.

**1.** To send a 160K-bit data block in 4 seconds on a channel with a bandwidth of 4KHz, according to
Shannon's formula, how many decibels should the signal-to-noise ratio of the channel be (take an
integer value)? (Please give the formula and calculation steps)
answer:
According to Shannon's theorem C=W.log2(1+S/N) for calculating channel capacity
According to the title C=160Kx8?4=40Kbps W=4KHz
So we get the solution: log2(1+S/ N)= 10 S/N=210-1=1023
(dB)=10log10(S/ N)= 10log10(1023)?31, so the decibel value of the integer value of the signal-to-noise
ratio is at least 31 decibels.

2. For an Ethernet with a length of 1km and a data transmission rate of 10Mbps, the transmission speed
of electrical signals on the Internet is 200m/ ms . Assume that the length of the Ethernet data frame is
256 bits, including a 64-bit frame header, checksum and other overheads. The first time slice after the
data frame is successfully sent is reserved for the receiver to send a 64-bit confirmation frame.
Assuming the network is very lightly loaded (i.e. disregarding any instances of collisions), what is the
effective data transfer rate for this Ethernet?
Answer: (1) The sending time used to send 256-bit data frame=256bits/10Mbps=25.6ms;
(2) The transmission time of the data frame on the cable = 1000m/(200m/ ms ) = 5ms;
The sending time used to send a 64-bit confirmation frame =64bits/10Mbps=6.4ms;
(4) The transmission time of the confirmation frame on the cable = 1000m/(200m/ ms ) = 5ms;
( 5) Valid data transmission rate = valid data sent/total time spent sending valid data,
And valid data = 256-64 = 192 bits, the total time taken to send 224 bits of valid data = 25.6ms + 5ms +
6.4ms + 5ms = 42ms; then the effective data transmission rate of the Ethernet is 192bits/38.8ms
=4.57Mbps.

protocol.

Computer network test question bank - short answer questions
and answers

**13.** What are the network topologies of commonly used LANs? Which structure is most popular now?
Why did early Ethernets choose bus topology over star topology, but now use star topology instead?
Answer: star network, bus network, ring network, tree network
At that time, the very reliable star topology was more expensive, and people thought that the passive
bus structure was more reliable, but practice has proved that the bus Ethernet with a large number of
sites is prone to failure, and now the use of dedicated ASIC chips can reduce The hub of the star
structure is very reliable, so the current Ethernet generally uses the topology of the star structure.

**14.** What are the characteristics of Ethernet switches? How to use it to form a virtual local area
network?
Answer: The Ethernet switch is a link layer device, which can realize transparent switching.
A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a logical group composed of some LAN segments that has nothing
to do with physical location.
These network segments have certain common requirements.

The virtual local area network protocol allows a 4-byte identifier to be inserted into the Ethernet frame
format, called a VLAN tag (tag), which is used to indicate which virtual local area network the
workstation sending the frame belongs to.

**15.** What is the working principle and characteristics of the bridge? How are bridges different from
repeaters and Ethernet switches?
Answer: The bridge works at the data link layer, and it forwards the received frame according to the
destination address of the MAC frame .
The bridge has the function of filtering frames. When a bridge receives a frame, instead of forwarding
the frame to all interfaces, it first checks the destination MAC address of the frame, and then
determines which interface to forward the frame to .
The repeater works on the physical layer, it simply forwards the signal without filtering capability.
Ethernet switches are link layer devices and can be viewed as multiport bridges.

**1.** The exchange method with the smallest transmission delay time is ( )

**2.** Some contact switches and links connecting these switches.

**7.** Physical address, MAC address.

**5.** The medium access control method of Ethernet is CSMA/CD, and its working principle is:
1) Send data:
Listen first and send, listen and send, stop conflict, extend and send
2) Receive data:
All network nodes on the Ethernet have been continuously monitoring the data on the network. Once a
carrier appears, it will start to intercept data from the network, and extract the destination MAC address
from the intercepted data. If the destination MAC address is itself, delete the MAC address. And pass
the data to the upper layer protocol.

packet switching from multiple aspects.
Answer: (1) Circuit switching: The quality of end-to-end communication is reliably guaranteed due to the
agreed communication resources, and it is highly efficient for continuous transmission of large amounts
of data.
(2) Message exchange: No need to reserve the transmission bandwidth, and the dynamic use of the
transmission bandwidth section by section has high efficiency and rapid communication for burst data
communication.

46 . What is store-and-forward switching?
Answer: In the store-and-forward switching mode, when a frame enters the switch from a port, the
entire received frame is first temporarily stored in the cache of the port. Thereafter, the switch checks
the port-address table according to the destination address in the buffer to obtain the output port
number, then forwards the frame to the output port, and outputs it to the destination station after
being cached by the output port.
47 Three processes of circuit switching.
Answer: 1) Circuit establishment: before any data is transmitted, an end-to-end circuit must be
established through the call process.
2) Data transmission: After the circuit is established, the data can be sent. During the entire data
transmission process, the established circuit must always remain connected.
3) Circuit dismantling: After the data transmission is completed, a party sends a dismantling request, and
then dismantles to the other node node by node.
48 Briefly describe the characteristics of the network architecture.
Answer: 1) Use function as the basis for dividing levels.
2) Entities at the nth layer can only use the services provided by the n-1 layer when implementing their
own defined functions.
3) When the nth layer provides services to the n+1th layer, this service not only includes the functions of
the nth layer itself, but also includes the functions provided by the lower layer services.
4) There are only interfaces between adjacent layers, and the specific implementation details of the
services provided are completely shielded from the upper layer.
49 what is a computer virus?

Answer A computer virus is a set of computer instructions or program codes that are compiled or
inserted into computer programs to destroy computer functions or data, affect computer use, and can
replicate themselves.
50 What is a firewall?
A firewall is a technical measure for network connection, restricting illegal access from external
networks to internal networks or protecting computer network security from internal networks to
external networks. It uses one or a group of network devices to construct a protective barrier between
the internal network and the external network to detect all internal and external illegal access and
protect the system itself from the impact of information traversal.

**6.** The router is a key component to implement packet switching , and its task is to forward received
packets, which is the most important function of the core part of the network.

**1.** (1) packet packet, add header
(2) store and forward via router
(3) merge at destination
The advantages of packet switching are:
1) Nodes temporarily store each group, not the entire data file.
2) The packet is temporarily stored in the memory of the node, which ensures a high exchange rate.
3) Channels are allocated dynamically, which greatly improves the utilization rate of communication
lines.
The disadvantages of packet switching are:
1) When the packet is forwarded by the node, it will cause a certain delay due to queuing
2) Packets must carry some control information and generate additional overhead, making management
and control difficult. )

1 Answer:
Since only binary signals are transmitted on the voice line, according to the Nyquist theorem, the
maximum data transmission rate is 6Kbps;
In addition, according to Shannon's theorem, the maximum data transmission rate is 30Kbps;
Take the lowest value between the two, and the answer is 6Kbps.

2 Answers:
(1) The sending time used to send 256-bit data frame=256bits/10Mbps=25.6ms;
(2) The transmission time of the data frame on the cable = 1000m/(200m/ ms ) = 5ms;
The sending time used to send a 64-bit confirmation frame =64bits/10Mbps=6.4ms;
(4) The transmission time of the confirmation frame on the cable = 1000m/(200m/ ms ) = 5ms;
(5) Valid data transmission rate = valid data sent/total time spent sending valid data,
And effective data = 256-64 = 192 bits, the total time taken to send 192 bits of effective data = 25.6ms +
5ms + 6.4ms + 5ms = 42ms; then the effective data transmission rate of the Ethernet is 192bits/42ms =
4.57Mbps.

4. Short answer questions (5 points each, 20 points in total)

**1.** A 3200-bit long TCP message is transmitted to the IP layer, and a 160-bit header is added to become a
datagram. The Internet below consists of two LANs connected by a router. But the data part in the
longest data frame that the second LAN can transmit is only 1200 bits. Therefore the datagram must be
fragmented at the router. How many bits of data should the second LAN transmit to its upper layer ( the
"data" here of course refers to the data seen by the LAN)?
Answer: The data part of the longest data frame that can be transmitted by the second LAN is only 1200
bits, that is, the data part of each IP data slice is <1200-160 (bit), because the slice offset is based on 8

bytes or 64 bits Unit, so the data part of the IP data slice does not exceed 1024bit at most, so the
3200bit message needs to be divided into 4 data slices, so the number of bits transmitted upward by the
second LAN is equal to (3200+4x160), a total of 3840bit.

**2.** In TCP congestion control, what are slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmission and fast
recovery algorithms? What is the role of each algorithm here ? What are the "multiplication reduction"
and "addition increase" used for? case?
Answer: Slow start:
When the host just starts to send the message segment, the congestion window cwnd can be set to the
value of the maximum message segment MSS. After each acknowledgment for a new segment is
received, the congestion window is increased by at most one MSS value. Using this method to gradually
increase the congestion window cwnd at the sending end can make the rate at which packets can be
injected into the network more reasonable.
Congestion avoidance:
When the congestion window value is greater than the slow start threshold, stop using the slow start
algorithm and use the congestion avoidance algorithm instead. The congestion avoidance algorithm
increases the size of MSS every time a round-trip time delay (RTT) of the sent congestion window
passes.
The fast retransmission algorithm stipulates:
As long as the sender receives three repeated ACKs in a row, it can be concluded that a packet is lost,
and it should immediately retransmit the lost segment without continuing to wait for the timeout of the
retransmission timer set for the segment.
Fast recovery algorithm:
When the sender receives three consecutive repeated ACKs, it resets the slow start threshold ssthresh
The difference from slow start is that the congestion window cwnd is not set to 1, but is set to ssthresh
repeated AVKs are received (n>3), set cwnd to ssthresh
If the sending window value still allows sending message segments, it will continue to send message
segments according to the congestion avoidance algorithm.
If an ACK confirming the new segment is received, shrink cwnd to ssthresh
Multiplicative reduction:
It means that no matter in the slow start phase or the congestion avoidance phase, as long as a timeout
occurs (that is, a network congestion occurs), the slow start threshold ssthresh is set to the current
congestion window value multiplied by 0.5.
When the network is frequently congested, the ssthresh value drops quickly to greatly reduce the
number of packets injected into the network.

Additive increase:
It means that after executing the congestion avoidance algorithm, after receiving the confirmation of all
message segments (that is, after a round-trip time), the congestion window cwnd is increased by an MSS
size, so that the congestion window increases slowly to prevent the network from appearing
prematurely. congestion.

Exercise 4. In packet-switched networks the factors that lead to the choice of small packets
dimensions are
A)
Lower incidence of control information, higher efficiency in the transfer of SDU's
big dimensions

B)
Better chance of parallelization, less transfer delay, less chance of error
on the bit
C)
Better chance of parallelization, less delay in packaging, less probability of
package error

Comment: Aloha has low efficiency because the nodes transmit without coordinating with each other, only in
the
In the event of a collision, a backoff is performed: the two (or more) stations that have collided wait for a time
random before retransmitting the PDU. The random time serves to break the determinism and if in the case the
two (or more) stations waited for the same time, a collision with probability 1 would again occur. In
this case doubles the maximum random waiting time.

Exercise 82. Consider two LANs
Ethernet A and B, connected by a switch B1 and a router R1 (B1 and R1 are in parallel between the two
LANs).
Suppose that the switch and the router have both ports active and know all the addresses (MAC
and IP respectively) of the hosts connected to the two LANs. When a host connected to LAN A broadcasts a
ARP packet to get the MAC address of router R1, which of the following statements is true?
A) The packet is forwarded on LAN B only by router R1
B) The packet is forwarded on LAN B only by switch B1
C) The packet is forwarded on LAN B either by the switch or by the router, depending on the address value

network with which one or more circuits are set up for connecting the user terminals; resources are
issued only at the end of the communication
C) The switching function does not allocate a subset of the
Network resources; all network resources are always available for packet transmission; the packages
they wait in special queues for the necessary resources to become available
Answer: B checked.
Comment: See transparencies "Switching to circuit".
Exercise 87. Version 4 IP addresses of class C characterize:
A) Multicast communications

Page 20
B) (Few) networks with
a large number of hosts

B) Pass it to a default application process that handles all TCP packets for which no
there is an application process available
C) Ignore the TCP port value and send the packet
D) Discard it and send an ICMP packet to the source
Answer: C verified
Comment: Since the TCP packet is encapsulated in an IP packet, the latter will not be able to detect

Page 26
Comment: In the case of datagrams (no virtual circuits), the pair must be identified in each packet
source / destination thing
which leads to a greater complexity of the performance of a network node. In the case of virtual circuits
instead, it is sufficient to identify the virtual circuit. The source / destination pair is used only
when opening the circuit. See slides "Addressing information".

package
B)
The Sequence Number field for numbering the segments
C)
The Identification 3e Fragment Offset fields that allow the management of the fragmentation of
packages
Answer: C verified.
Comment: Answer A is wrong, since the checksum header does not check for correctness
of the data but only the correctness of the header.
The B is wrong because the IP does not guarantee the order of arrival of the packets.
The C is correct as it corresponds with the definition of the Fragment Offset.
Exercise 118. Why does VDSL technology have high performance only if the distance between the cab
of road and user's home is less than a hundred meters?

Answer: B checked.
Comment: Answer A is wrong as after the DHCP offer I only have suggestions. Only after
the DHCP ACK the client can make use of the IP address offered by the DHCP server. The C is wrong since
There can be multiple DHCP servers on a client's local network. The D is wrong, in fact the DHCP server
provides the DHCP client with IP addresses of one or more DNS servers. By exclusion, the right answer is B.

Exercise 133. In the case in which a window protocol is used on a channel that does not allow inversions
in the sequence order of the data units transmitted (ie on a sequential channel), assuming
use a non-cyclic progressive numbering, the transmission and reception windows cannot
never find yourself in the following situation:
A)
No sequence number included in the receive window is also included in the window
transmission
B)
The smallest sequence number in the transmission window is smaller than the smallest
sequence number in the receiving window
C)
The smallest sequence number in the receive window is smaller than the smallest number of
sequence in the transmission window.
D)

sequence in the transmission window
Answer: C verified.
Comment: A is possible in case all packets have been received but still no ACK is
arrived at the transmitter. B and D are both the case where the receiver window is advanced but the
transmitter has not yet received ACK. C cannot occur because the send window can
advance only after receiving ACKs which must be sent by the receiver after the
receiving a packet, but receiving it would necessarily involve a slide forward of the receiver, therefore
the receiver never falls behind the transmitter.
